* Shahin's Personal Dotfiles

Hi, this is my personal dot files repository and there are two main
reason for me to share them here:

1. Easy sync between different machines.
2. Easy to refer to my code when talking about my setup with a friend or
   a colleague.

** Philosophy

- Everything should be configured through files, so I can make backup
  of them and re-use on other devices I own.
- The software I use should have minimal memory footprint. Fully
  fledged desktop environments or the new IDE in town might be
  comfortable to use, but in high intense debug sessions, I don't want
  to worry about my memory consumption. Example:
  + Intellij! Set aside, the abstraction it adds to help developers,
    sometimes gets in the way of the actual maintenance like when it
    involves Spark applications on JVM stack.
- I prefer to use keybindings to communicate with my tools as much as
  possible.
- Prefer fully fledged programming languages for configuration,
  instead of DSL. DSL's will limit you, while with a programming
  language the sky is your limit. Example:
  - ~Qtile~ instead of ~i3~ or ~wayland~.
  - ~CDK~ instead of ~Terraform~. ~Ansible~ is an exception for now, there
    is no better alternative for it yet.
- If possible to re-use one tool for many purposes, I'll do that. It
  means, I can re-use my knowledge around that tool, to achieve what I
  need, without learning a new tool. Example:
  + Use `org-mode` and `org-roam` instead of `obsidian`, which is
    cool, and provides things that is harder to support in Emacs, but
    I don't need all of those features either.
